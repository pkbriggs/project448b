# Project4448B

Stanford CS448B final project by Erin Singer, John Newcomb, and Pat Briggs.

### Running Instructions
Do **not** simply open `index.html` - run a server first and access it through that. D3 does not like being served locally. One method you can use:

* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Go to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) in your browser
